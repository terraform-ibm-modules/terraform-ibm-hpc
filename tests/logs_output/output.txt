### Test Output Logs

- **Console Output**: Check the console for detailed test results.
- **Log Files**: Review `test_output.log` and custom logs in the `/tests/test_output` folder with a timestamp for detailed analysis and troubleshooting. For example, a log file might be named `log_20XX-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.log`.
