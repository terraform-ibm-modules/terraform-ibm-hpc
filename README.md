# IBM Cloud HPC
Repository for the IBM Cloud HPC project with IBM Spectrum schedulers

## Deploying the environment using CLI:

### Initial configuration:

```
$ ibmcloud iam api-key-create user-api-key --file ~/.ibm-api-key.json -d "ibmcloud_api_key"
$ cat ~/.ibm-api-key.json | jq -r ."apikey"
# copy your apikey
```

### 1. Deployment with Catalog CLI on IBM Cloud

Use the below IBM Cloud CLI command to create catalog workspace with specific product version. Update the custom configuration and cluster name as per the requirement.
Note: IBM Catalog management plug-in must be pre-installed. [Learn more](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cli-manage-catalogs-plugin)

```
$ cp sample/configs/hpc_catalog_values.json values.json
$ vim values.json
# Paste your API key and other mandatory parameters value for IBM Cloud HPC cluster
# Login to the IBM Cloud CLI
$ ibmcloud catalog install --vl <version-locator-value> --override-values values.json

Note: You can retrieve the <version-locator-value> by accessing the CLI section within the Deployment options of the IBM Cloud HPC tile.

It bears resemblance to something along these lines:
$ ibmcloud catalog install --vl 1082e7d2-5e2f-0a11-a3bc-f88a8e1931fc.c7645085-5f49-4d5f-8786-45ac376e60fe-global --override-values values.json

You can refer the Schematics workspace url (next to Schematics workspace:) as part of the install command output.

### 2. Deployment with Schematics CLI on IBM Cloud

**Note**: You also need to generate GitHub token if you use private GitHub repository.

```
$ cp sample/configs/hpc_schematics_values.json values.json
$ vim values.json
# Paste your API key and other mandatory parameters value for IBM Cloud HPC cluster
# Login to the IBM Cloud CLI
$ ibmcloud schematics workspace new -f values.json --github-token xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

### Accessing the deployed environment:

* Connect to an LSF login node through SSH by using the `ssh_to_login_node` command from the Schematics log output.
```
ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -J vpcuser@<floating_IP_address> lsfadmin@<login_node_IP_address>
```
* where `floating_IP_address` is the floating IP address for the bastion node and `login_node_IP_address` is the IP address for the login node.

### Steps to access the Application Center GUI/Dashboard:

* Open a new command line terminal.
* Connect to an LSF management node through SSH by using the `application_center_tunnel` command from the Schematics log output.

```
ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o ServerAliveInterval=5 -o ServerAliveCountMax=1 -L 8443:localhost:8443 -L 6080:localhost:6080 -J vpcuser@><floating_IP_address> lsfadmin@<management_node_IP_address>
```
* where `floating_IP_address` is the floating IP address for the bastion node and `management_node_IP_address` is the IP address for the management node.

* Open a browser on the local machine, and run https://localhost:8443

* To access the Application Center GUI, enter the password you configured when you created your workspace and the default user as "lsfadmin".

* If LDAP is enabled, you can access the LSF Application Center using the LDAP username and password that you configured during IBM CloudÂ® HPC cluster deployment or using an existing LDAP username and password.

* If IBM Spectrum LSF Application Center GUI is installed in High Availability. The `application_center_tunnel` command is a bit different. Then read also `application_center_url_note` line.
```
"ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o ServerAliveInterval=5 -o ServerAliveCountMax=1 -L 8443:pac.<domain_name>:8443 -L 6080:pac.<domain_name>:6080 -J vpcuser@<floating_IP_address> lsfadmin@<login_vsi_IP_address>"
application_center_url = "https://pac.<domain_name>:8443"
```

### Steps to validate the OpenLDAP:
* Connect to your OpenLDAP server through SSH by using the `ssh_to_ldap_node` command from the Schematics log output.

```
ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o ServerAliveInterval=5 -o ServerAliveCountMax=1 -J vpcuser@<floatingg_IP_address> ubuntu@<LDAP_server_IP>
```
* where `floating_IP_address` is the floating IP address for the bastion node and `LDAP_server_IP` is the IP address for the OpenLDAP node.

* Verifiy the LDAP service status:

```
systemctl status slapd
```

* Verify the LDAP groups and users created:

```
ldapsearch -Q -LLL -Y EXTERNAL -H ldapi:///
```

* Submit a Job from HPC cluster Management node with LDAP user : Log into the management node using the `ssh_to_management_node` value as shown as part of output section of Schematics job log:

```
ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -J vpcuser@<floating_IP_address> lsfadmin@<management_node_IP_address>
```
* where `floating_IP_address` is the floating IP address for the bastion node and `management_node_IP_address` is the IP address for the management node.

* Switch to the LDAP user (for example, switch to lsfuser05):

```
[lsfadmin@hpccluster-mgmt-1 ~]$ su lsfuser05
Password:
[lsfuser05@hpccluster-mgmt-1 lsfadmin]#
```

* Submit an LSF job as the LDAP user:

```
[lsfuser05@hpccluster-mgmt-1 lsfadmin]$ bsub -J myjob[1-4] -R "rusage[mem=2G]" sleep 10
Job <1> is submitted to default queue <normal>.
```

### Cleaning up the deployed environment:

If you no longer need your deployed IBM Cloud HPC cluster, you can clean it up from your environment. The process is threefold: ensure that the cluster is free of running jobs or working compute nodes, destroy all the associated VPC resources and remove them from your IBM Cloud account, and remove the project from the IBM Cloud console.

**Note**: Ensuring that the cluster is free of running jobs and working compute nodes

Ensure that it is safe to destroy resources:

1. As the `lsfadmin` user, close all LSF queues and kill all jobs:
   ```
    badmin qclose all
    bkill -u all 0
    ```

2. Wait ten minutes (this is the default idle time), and then check for running jobs:
    ```
    bjobs -u all
    ```

   Look for a `No unfinished job found` message.


3. Check that there are no compute nodes (only management nodes should be listed):
   ```
    bhosts -w
   ```

If the cluster has no running jobs or compute nodes, then it is safe to destroy resources from this environment.

#### Destroying resources

1. In the IBM Cloud console, from the **Schematics > Workspaces** view, select **Actions > Destroy resources** > **Confirm** the action by entering the workspace name in the text box and click Destroy to delete all the related VPC resources that were deployed.
2. If you select the option to destroy resources, decide whether you want to destroy all of them. This action cannot be undone.
3. Confirm the action by entering the workspace name in the text box and click **Destroy**.
You can now safely remove the resources from your account.

#### Accessing HPC Tile on Other Regions
1. If there is a requirement to create HPC cluster other than us-east/us-south/eu-de region, HPC cluster can still be provisioned on another regions.
2. Instead of using the IBMCloudHPC provider, the automation uses the IBMCloudgen2 providers to spun up the dynamic nodes.
3. Also instead of using the proxy API URL, a vpc generic API shall be used to spin up the dynamic nodes in the same account as user's.
4. When creating HPC cluster on different different regions, contract id and cluster id basically not needed. So provide a random contract id and cluster_id.
