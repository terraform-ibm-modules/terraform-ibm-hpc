# IAM Permissions Assignment for LSF Deployment

### Before deploying an IBM Cloud LSF cluster, specific IAM permissions must be assigned to either a user or an access group. This script automates that process.

How to run:

```
ibmcloud login --apikey <YOUR_API_KEY> -g <RESOURCE_GROUP>

chmod +x permissions.sh

./permissions.sh
```
